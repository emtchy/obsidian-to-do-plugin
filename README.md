# Obsidian ToDo Plugin

An Obsidian plugin that automatically generates structured to-do notes at regular intervals (daily, weekly, every N days, or manually on click).  
It also **carries over unfinished tasks** from the previous note and archives the old file â€” keeping your task management tidy and consistent.

This plugin is based on the [Obsidian sample plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin), but has been extended and customized.

## Features

- Generate new task notes automatically:
	- **Daily**
	- **Weekly (Monday)**
	- **Every N days** (customizable)
	- **On click** via ribbon icon
- Automatically **move old notes to an archive** folder.
- Carry over all **unfinished tasks** into the new note.
- Notes marked with **'X' or 'x'** are considered done in the corresponding column.
- Provides a simple **table structure** for tasks:
  ```markdown
  |Subject|Task|Due|Done|
  |-|-|-|-|
